Alarm Clock
Build an online alarm clock using Moment.js! Here are some goals for this project:

Continue to get used to using Gulp in your projects. Start this project by following along with all the Gulp lessons from this weekend and yesterday to build a full asset pipeline with a development server. You should be moving towards a template project structure that you can continue to use throughout the week including package.json file, a complete gulpfile.js with all tasks, and a basic folder structure.
Use this project to build up to working with APIs. Work on figuring out 3rd party documentation by using Moment.js - API documentation can be very daunting, so this should be a good place to start practicing your research skills.
Review your jQuery for allowing your users to interact with your alarm clock in the browser.
Continue to practice Object Oriented JavaScript concepts.
Follow along with the Bower lesson to install jQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.js. Here are some goals to get you started:

As a user of your alarm clock, I would like to be able to view the current time.
I would also like to be able to enter a time into a form to set an alarm.
The alarm should turn on at the specified alarm time.
As a user, when the alarm turns on I want it to either show me something on the screen (like a picture/animation) or make a sound, or both.
Further Exploration

Bonus goals are below! These are optional - come back to them if you have extra time after working on the weather app.

As a user I would like to be able to hit a snooze button, which makes the alarm turn off and then be activated again five minutes later.
I'd like the ability to change the amount of snooze time if I would actually prefer another ten minutes of sleep, instead of five.
As a user I would like to be able to set multiple alarms because mornings are hard.
